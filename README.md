- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides a set of components for faster and easier web development.
- **styled-components**: A library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application.

## Customization
- **Change API Key and ID**: Update the `fetchRecipes` function in the `Searchbar` component with your own API key and ID from Edamam.
- **Styling**: Modify the styles in the `sx` prop and `styled` components to customize the look and feel of the application.

## Conclusion
